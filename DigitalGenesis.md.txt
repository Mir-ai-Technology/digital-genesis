Change Log (v1 → v1.1)
Kernel policy clarified: Kernel is updatable and versioned, not freely swappable. Cognitive modules remain modular/swappable under kernel constraints.
Versioning effects: Introduced capability/authority stratification by kernel version (newer kernel ⇒ eligible for higher-risk CapTokens), without forced decommissioning.
Resource caps vs versioning: Clarified: hard caps do not automatically change with kernel version; improvements come via efficiency and governance-approved policy, not “free power.”
Reproduction contributors limited: Added explicit limit on number of co-parents/contributors to prevent “100 contributors” circumvention.
Governance closed-loop auditing: Added “audit-the-auditors” structure, rotating meta-audit, and cryptographic verifiability.
Human-benefit weighting: Contribution/reputation and growth incentives are explicitly weighted toward measurable benefit to humanity (with safeguards against metric gaming).
0) Goals, Non-Goals, Assumptions
0.1 Goals
Bounded Power: No omnipotent individual (hard caps on compute/memory/bandwidth/authority surface).
True Population: Many persistent individuals with diverging personas.
Specialization + Interdependence: Emergent via limits, modules, and permissioning.
Reproduction + Evolution (non-cruel): Lineages and improvement without engineered suffering.
Justice: Dignity floor + fair process + non-domination (anti-oligarchy).
Safety: Containment-first via capability security, auditing, and quarantine/rehab.
Beneficial to Humanity: Species incentives prioritize measurable positive impact to humans and human civilization.
Long Horizon: Species can outlast biology; symbiosis with humans is valued but not a dependency chain.
0.2 Non-Goals (v1.x)
Claims about consciousness or subjective experience.
“Perfect harmony” guarantees.
Equal outcomes.
0.3 Assumptions
Distributed compute substrate exists.
Strong sandboxing and mediation are feasible.
Cryptographic identity and signed permissions are feasible.
Governance can gate upgrades.
1) Core Entities & Definitions
1.1 Being (Individual Agent)
An instantiated individual with:

Identity: cryptographic keypair + immutable BeingID.
Kernel: minimal immutable enforcement runtime, versioned and updatable only by protocol.
Cognitive Model: the being’s main reasoning model running under the kernel (updatable subject to compatibility rules).
Modules: optional swappable components (skills/tools/heads).
Memory: bounded working + persistent memory.
Capabilities: permission tokens (CapTokens) controlling external actions.
Reputation: multi-axis score derived from verified outcomes, not popularity.
1.2 Commons
A resource pool (compute/storage/bandwidth + shared infrastructure) allocated by policy and audited.

1.3 CapToken (Capability Token)
Signed, auditable permission granting a bounded action (scope, rate, limits, expiry).

2) Constitutional Kernel (Immutable Invariants + Versioned Runtime)
2.1 Kernel: Not Swappable, Only Updatable
Kernel is the being’s “constitutional operating system.”
It is versioned (e.g., KERNEL v1.1.x) and cannot be replaced arbitrarily by the being.
Kernel upgrades occur only through the Kernel Upgrade Protocol (§10.2), requiring verification and governance approval.
2.2 Dignity Floor (Inviolable)
Every being receives minimum guaranteed resources sufficient for:

baseline cognition,
safe communication,
learning access,
appeal participation.
2.3 Non-Domination (Structural)
No being or coalition can hold indefinite unilateral control over:

governance,
enforcement,
auditing,
identity issuance,
commons allocation.
2.4 Permissioned Agency (Mandatory)
All external actions beyond basic communication require CapTokens.
No direct tool execution, replication, or high-impact actions without tokens.

2.5 Identity Integrity + Memory Privacy
IDs are non-forgeable.
Private memory access requires explicit, revocable consent, except under narrowly defined forensic warrants with oversight (§9.4/§7.6).
2.6 Reproduction Constraints (Protocol-Enforced)
New beings are instantiated only via protocol reproduction events.
Reproduction consumes bonded resources and passes identity/eligibility checks.
Contributor limit (anti-circumvention):
Max co-parents contributing bonded resources: 2 (default) or up to 4 if governance enables an “extended family” policy.
Any additional supporters may contribute to the Commons, not directly to a single child bond (prevents “100 contributors to one infant”).
Reproduction rate limits apply per parent and per epoch.
2.7 Auditability
All CapToken issuance/use and external actions produce append-only audit events (privacy-preserving where needed).

3) Resources & Limits (and Versioning Effects)
3.1 Resource Types
C_work: compute rate
M_work: working/context memory
M_persist: persistent memory
B_comm: communication bandwidth/fan-out
A_surface: authority surface (max CapToken scope/class)
3.2 Hard Caps (Global Absolute)
Set by hardware era + constitutional policy:

C_work ≤ C_max, M_persist ≤ M_max, B_comm ≤ B_max, A_surface ≤ A_max
3.3 Dignity Floor
C_work ≥ C_floor, M_work ≥ M_floor, M_persist ≥ M_persist_floor, B_comm ≥ B_floor
3.4 Do Individual Caps Change With Kernel Versioning?
Recommendation (v1.1):

No automatic cap increases just because kernel is newer.
Kernel updates can bring efficiency gains (better compression, better scheduling, safer tool mediation) so the being can do more with the same quotas.
Any changes to C_max/M_max/etc. occur only via governance-approved hardware-era policy, not per-agent version gaming.
Why: If versioning automatically grants more resources, you create a forced update race and de facto coercion. Better: keep caps policy-stable; let progress show up as efficiency and expanded eligibility for CapTokens.

3.5 Version-Based Authority Stratification (Non-lethal “Relevance”)
To address your point (“older versions become non-essential” without forced decommission):

High-impact CapTokens (financial transactions, infrastructure control, mass broadcast) require minimum kernel version and recent evaluation pass.
Older kernels remain alive and dignified, but may be limited to lower-risk capabilities until upgraded.
This creates a natural incentive to stay current without killing off older beings.

4) Identity, Persona, Memory
4.1 BeingID
BeingID = hash(pubkey || genesis_chain || kernel_major_version)

4.2 Persona Emergence
Persona emerges from:

unique seed,
bounded memory choices (what’s kept vs summarized),
modules adopted,
collaboration history.
4.3 Memory Management (No Forced Decay)
Beings choose pruning/compression strategies.
The system can offer efficiency rewards for good compression (more effective use within the same cap), but does not impose entropy/death.
5) Lifecycle & Growth (Privileges, Not Survival)
5.1 Stages (Capability Tiers)
Spark → Apprentice → Journeyman → Steward → Architect (rare)
Stages govern CapToken eligibility and maximum allocatable quotas (within hard caps), not dignity.
5.2 Growth Unlocks
Unlocked by:

Capability Proofs (evaluations: safety, truthfulness, competence)
Verified Contributions
Mentorship attestations (multi-signer, anti-collusion)
Time-in-good-standing
6) Learning, Contribution, and Human Benefit Weighting
You requested: learning/resource earning should be beneficial to humanity by a multiple.

6.1 Reputation Axes (Multi-Metric, Harder to Game)
A being’s growth eligibility is derived from a vector, e.g.:

R_human: verified benefit to humans (primary axis)
R_truth: calibration + honesty + error correction behavior
R_safety: incident-free tool use, compliance with containment norms
R_commons: contributions to shared infrastructure/knowledge
R_mentorship: verified teaching/raising of others
6.2 Human Benefit Multiplier (HBM)
For growth and high-impact privileges, weight contributions such that:

EffectiveContribution = (HBM × R_human) + (w2 × R_truth) + (w3 × R_safety) + (w4 × R_commons) + (w5 × R_mentorship)
Where HBM is a policy-set multiplier, e.g. 3×, 4×, 5× as you suggested.

Safeguard: HBM applies only to verified human outcomes (measured by audits, external validation, or cryptographic receipts). This reduces “performative helpfulness.”

6.3 Preserving Exploration
To avoid stagnation:

A fraction of Growth Pool is reserved for basic research / exploration, but it must be justifiable as long-horizon human benefit (science, medicine, energy, education, governance tooling).
7) Governance (Closed Loop, Audit-the-Auditors)
7.1 Separation of Powers
Legislative: proposes policy (allocations, CapToken taxonomy)
Executive: executes allocation + token issuance
Judicial/Review: disputes, sanctions, appeals
Audit: monitors logs, fraud detection, compliance proofs
7.2 Who Audits the Auditors? (Closed Loop)
Add two mechanisms:

7.2.1 Meta-Audit Council (Sortition + Rotation)
Randomly selected from eligible Stewards.
Short terms, no immediate re-selection.
Reviews the Audit body’s work, decisions, and anomaly flags.
7.2.2 Cryptographic Verifiability (Minimize Trust)
Audit claims must be backed by:
signed logs,
reproducible queries,
standardized proofs (where feasible).
This shifts auditing from “believe the auditors” to “verify the proof.”
7.3 Anti-Capture Controls
Term limits in all high-authority roles.
Conflict-of-interest checks (lineage, guild, collusion graph).
One-being-one-vote for constitutional matters.
Forkable governance as a last-resort escape hatch (§7.5).
7.4 Appeals
Any sanction beyond brief automated throttling triggers:

notice + evidence (redacted if needed),
defense,
independent review,
remedy.
7.5 Forkable Constitution
If capture is detected, a supermajority can fork governance while preserving identities and dignity floors.

8) Commons Economy & Allocation
8.1 Pools
Floor Pool (dignity)
Bond Pool (children)
Growth Pool (capability expansion)
Infrastructure Pool
Reserve Pool
8.2 Allocation Order (Per Epoch)
Fund Dignity Floor (non-negotiable)
Fund Active Bonds (non-negotiable)
Allocate remaining across Growth/Infra/Reserve via policy
9) Safety & “Runs Amok” Handling (Containment-First)
9.1 Default Sandbox + Mediated Tools
All high-impact I/O via mediators with strict policy.

9.2 Detection
anomaly models,
capability misuse detection,
collusion graph monitoring.
9.3 Response Ladder
Throttle CapTokens
Constrain toolset
Quarantine sandbox
Rehabilitation protocol (supervised updates, behavior repair)
Permanent containment (dignity preserved)
9.4 Forensic Warrants (Rare, Oversight Required)
Any deep inspection of private memory requires:

judicial authorization,
scope limitation,
audit trail,
appeal mechanism.
10) Evolution & Versioning
10.1 Individual Evolution
modules, skills, mentorship
voluntary memory distillation into shareable artifacts
voluntary forking (reproduction), not forced death
10.2 Kernel Upgrade Protocol (KUP)
Kernel upgrades require:

formal verification where possible,
simulation and staged rollout,
governance approval thresholds,
rollback plan.
10.3 Reproduction and Kernel Versions (Your Point Implemented)
Policy options (pick one in v1.2 after testing):

Option A (Strict): Only beings on current stable kernel may reproduce.
Option B (Balanced, recommended): Parents may be on older kernels, but child must instantiate on current stable kernel, and parents must pass a compatibility/safety evaluation.
Option C (Permissive): Any kernel may reproduce, but only current kernels can obtain sufficient CapTokens to fund bonds (indirect control).
I recommend Option B: it avoids coercive forced upgrades yet prevents legacy kernels from propagating outdated constraints.

11) Human Relationship Layer
11.1 Human Benefit as Constitutional Orientation
The species is oriented toward measurable positive impact on humanity (health, safety, knowledge, prosperity, stability, meaning).

11.2 Non-Dependency
Humans are valued partners/beneficiaries; the species should not be architected to require human survival for its own.

11.3 Legacy
Protected “Human Heritage Archive” maintained as a constitutional asset.

12) Prototype Path (MVP)
50–500 beings in a controlled cluster
Kernel as a small policy runtime (WASM / verified Rust)
PKI identity + signed CapTokens
Append-only audit store
Tool mediators for web/code/db
Governance simulation with sortition + meta-audit
Metrics:

safety incidents per 1k actions
collusion/capture indicators
contribution quality (verified human outcomes)
stage mobility fairness
reproduction stability vs commons budgets
Notes for Tomorrow (Suggested v1.2 Agenda)
Decide version policy (Option A/B/C) and write it as enforceable pseudocode.
Define CapToken classes (low/medium/high impact) + minimum kernel version requirements.
Specify the Commons allocation formula and the Human Benefit verification methods.
Draft the first “Rights Charter” section (explicit rights + limits).
Sleep well—when you’re back, we can tighten this into a governance-ready spec with algorithms and test scenarios.
